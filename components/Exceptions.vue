      <h2>Exceptions</h2>

      <p>Directive 2019/882 has the concept of "undue burden", meaning the Directive's accessibility rules apply,</p>

      <ul>
        <li>…unless they would change the very nature of the product or service respectively.</li>
        <li>…unless the accessibility requirements would overburden the company financially.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>But that does not mean but that does not mean that the directive has major gaps in its applicability. Many companies in the European Union will be impacted by the European Accessibility Act. <strong>Only micro-enterprises, i.e. enterprises which employ fewer than 10 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 2&nbsp;million, are excluded and can reference the "undue burden exemption".</strong>
