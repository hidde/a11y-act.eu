    <h2>What is yet unclear</h2>

      <p>One has to keep in mind: It is not the EU directive that is decisive or jurisdiction, but the respective national implementation law. This means that the directive is not designed to cover all eventualities. Rather, its role is to set the regulatory direction that national laws should take. Nevertheless, here is an excerpt of questions that are still open:</p>

      <ul class="text-list">
        <li>Member States shall develop, implement and regularly update appropriate procedures to monitor accessibility requirements for services, follow up complaints, control corrective action. <strong>But how will this look in concrete terms? Which organisations will be designated?</strong></li>
        <li>Since the Member States must inform the public of the existence of a law derived from the EAA - so that citizens know their rights - what exactly will this involve?</li>
        <li>Regarding websites and apps: So far, the directive does not refer to any concrete technical standards (as is the case with Directive 2016/2102, for example). Will this remain this way? If so, what is the expectation horizon to which companies must then orient themselves?</li>
        <li>Since Member States may demand fines for those who do not comply with the law - what will they look like?</li>
      </ul>
